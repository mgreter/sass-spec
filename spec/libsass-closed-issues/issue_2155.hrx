WARNING on line 2, column 5 of input.scss:
You probably don't mean to use the color value `#ff0' in interpolation here.
It may end up represented as #ffff00, which will likely produce invalid CSS.
Always quote color names when using them as strings (for example, "#ff0").
If you really want to use the color value here, use `"" + #ff0'.

Error: Invalid CSS after "&.": expected class name, was "#ff0"

WARNING on line 2, column 7 of input.scss:
You probably don't mean to use the color value yellow in interpolation here.
It may end up represented as #ff0, which will likely produce invalid CSS. Always
quote color names when using them as strings or map keys (for example,
"yellow"). If you really want to use the color value, append it to an empty
string first to avoid this warning (for example, '"" + yellow').
